**Project features are given below:** 
- **Search bar:** There is a search bar on my project where users can search for the category they want to donate to. Data will be shown based on the search.
- **Pie Chart:** My project includes a pie chart. The pie chart shows two data values: total donations and users' donations. So users can easily see the percentage of how many events they have donated and how many are left. The data is shown in percentages.
- **Navbar with Active Route:** The navbar has a feature that highlights active routes so users can easily know which route they are on.
- **404 Route**: Instances where a page cannot be found are handled with a custom 404 route.
- **Responsiveness:** The website is responsive on a range of gadgets, including tablets, smartphones, and desktop computers.
